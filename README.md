- 👋 Hi! I’m Erik.
  I am from Slovakia. I have been working for FPT Slovakia s.r.o. for 3.5 years as .NET developer.
  
- 🌱 I’m currently learning React Native on udemy.com during the free time and I’m implementing (to be precise, I’m trying to implement) a few small mobile apps
  to get experiences to become good React Native developer. :)
  
- 👀 Althought I am .NET developer, I’m also interested in React.js (Next.js) and React Native projects to get further experiences of the frontent development.

- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on backend web apps in .NET development or development of client apps in React.js.
- 📫 You can reach me out on my LinkedIn account: https://sk.linkedin.com/in/erik-hanc-20548037

- 👋 Cheers!
